In this project, you’ll use the Lightning Design System along with Visualforce to build a page that displays your contacts as tile components. The page will conform to the new Lightning UI look and feel, and you don't have to write a single line of CSS in the process!

The Lightning Design System consists of a few different pieces:

CSS framework
HTML components
Icons
Design tokens
Design guidelines
Over the course of this project, we’ll focus on the CSS framework, HTML components, and briefly cover icons. For a more detailed introduction of the Lightning Design System, check out the documentation on the Lightning Design System site.

Lightning Design System is quite a mouthful, so we’ll be referring to it here as the Design System.
